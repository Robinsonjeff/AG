# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### To-Do List

Next Step is to create a component that can be switched too via nav bar. I want this too have icons and brief text below should be a fairly small component without much to read.

Then need to add the two nav bar pieces to navigate between about us and this component. Use info below.

Need to do mobile where we service.

## REGULAR

Need to fix auto scroll on about me page and rest of pages. Either take it all away or fix it on everything aside from about us.

Find a picture for about us to be picture 3

Fix FAQ. Make Question divs fit better for the questions. add same drop shadow mobile has to the answers. (Maybe - see what james thinks.) Also add padding to the right of the question divs.

Whole website is too big. There shouldnt be a side scroll. That needs to go. Make it fit the screen
